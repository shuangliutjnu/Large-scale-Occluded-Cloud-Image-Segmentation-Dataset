# Large-scale-Occluded-Cloud-Image-Segmentation-Dataset
Large-scale Occluded Cloud Image Segmentation Dataset (LOCISD) is collected from 2019 to 2023 in nine provinces of China, which includes Tianjin, Anhui, Sichuan, Gansu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Hainan. The LOCISD is the first three-category ground-based cloud image segmentation dataset that considers occlusion labels. It contains 5000 ground-based cloud images and their corresponding cloud masks. The LOCISD is composed of 2100 training images and 2900 test images. The cloud images are captured by visual sensors and stored in the PNG format with the pixel resolution of  512Ã—512. All the images are cooperatively annotated by the meteorologists and the cloud-related researchers from College of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China, and Meteorological Observation Centre, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing, China. The LOCISD will be provided free of charge to cloud-related researchers in order to promote research. Hereunder, some ground-based cloud images and their cloud masks are presented.
